# Write a function to detect if 2 strings are anagrams of each other.

## For testing purposes

**An anagram is:**

- Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in *another order*
- Every letter must be used, with exactly the same number of occurrences as in the anagrammed word or phrase
- Don't worry about uppercase/lowercase/punctuation. Tests will only contain lowercase characters and spaces

## Yes, there are tests

- In this directory run ```npm install```
- Create a directory naming it after your username
- Add a file to the new directory called anagram.js
- In anagram.js export a function called compare that takes 2 arguments and returns a boolean determining whether the arguments are anagrams of each other eg. ``` module.exports.compare = function (str1, str2) { /* do stuff here before returning true or false */ };```
- run ```npm test```
